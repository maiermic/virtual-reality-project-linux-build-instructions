# Virtual Reality Project - Linux Build Instructions

I will explain how to

 - build Boost, OpenSG2, VRPN and inVRs in Linux
 - configure, build and run the initial student project (of lecture [Virtual Reality][vr-lecture] at Ludwig Maximilians University Munich).

## Project

The initial `cmake` configuration of the student project only allows to develop in Windows and run the project in the cave at V2C/LRZ. We will modify the configuration files and install the required dependencies. Our goal is to be able to run it on our Linux system. I use Linux Mint 18, but you should be able to adjust the instructions to your distribution.
