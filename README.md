# Virtual Reality Project - Linux Build Instructions

I will explain how to

 - build Boost, OpenSG2, VRPN and inVRs in Linux (tested on Mint 18 Mate)
 - configure, build and run the initial student project (of lecture [Virtual Reality][vr-lecture] at Ludwig Maximilians University Munich).

## Project

Our goal is to be able to run the initial student project on our Linux system. The initial `cmake` configuration only allows to develop in Windows and run the project in the cave at V2C/LRZ. We will modify the configuration files and install the required dependencies.
